AI DevSpace Platform Production Readiness
Transform the AI DevSpace platform from prototype to fully functional production-ready system by fixing GitHub integration, implementing complete chat system with empowered AI agents, resolving project opening/navigation issues, implementing per-project chat management, adding full Git CRUD operations, and establishing proper mobile-first architecture with global chat navigation.
Fix GitHub OAuth device flow integration and connection status: Ensure ConnectGitHub component properly handles device flow polling and stores tokens, update src/services/githubAuth.ts to handle token refresh and expiration gracefully, integrate GitHub connection status into SettingsPage with visual indicators showing connected account, implement automatic repository detection after successful authentication displaying user's repos, add disconnect functionality with secure token revocation, and resolve any runtime errors in GitHub API calls by adding proper error boundaries and retry logic.
Implement complete project opening and navigation system: Fix EnhancedProjectsPage project cards to properly navigate to project workspace when clicked (implement onClick handler that sets active project and navigates to workspace view), create dedicated project workspace view (src/pages/ProjectWorkspacePage.tsx) that shows project-specific navigation (Files, Terminal, Git, Chat, Settings), update ProjectContext to properly manage active project state and persist across navigation, implement project loading states with skeleton screens, add project-specific header showing current project name, branch, and sync status, and create project closing functionality that saves state before switching projects.
Build production-grade chat system with fully empowered AI agents: Enhance ChatPage from basic placeholder to fully functional chat interface with message list, input area, and streaming response display using useChatStore, implement complete AI agent tooling including diff-first file editing (integrate with DiffViewer component), terminal command execution (integrate with Terminal component), web search capabilities (integrate with webSearchIntegration service), vector memory access for context retrieval, autonomous task execution via agentOrchestra service, and full Git CRUD operations (commit, push, pull, branch management), create agent selection UI allowing users to assign specific agents (Planner, Coder, Designer, Debugger, Reviewer, Deployer) to conversations, implement chat streaming with real-time token display and proper cancellation, and add chat export/import functionality for backup and sharing.
Implement per-project chat system with multiple parallel conversations: Restructure chat architecture to support multiple parallel chat threads per project by adding threadId to ChatMessage schema, create chat thread management UI in ProjectWorkspacePage showing list of active threads with titles and last message preview, implement chat thread creation, deletion, and archiving functionality, add thread-specific context loading that includes relevant project files, git history, and memories, create thread switcher component allowing seamless navigation between conversations within a project, implement cross-thread memory sharing where insights from one conversation can inform others, and add thread search functionality to find messages across all project chats.
Build global chat navigation system in bottom nav: Transform MobileBottomNav chat button to open global chat management interface (src/components/GlobalChatManager.tsx) showing all chats across all projects organized by project with thread counts, implement project grouping with expandable sections showing individual threads within each project, add recent chats section showing last 5 accessed threads across all projects for quick access, create chat search functionality that searches messages across all projects and threads, implement chat filtering by project, agent, date range, or keywords, add quick access to create new chat in current project or switch to existing chat from any project, ensure proper state management so active chat persists across navigation, and add unread message indicators on chat items showing new AI responses.
Implement complete Git operations with full CRUD and diff-first editing: Enhance src/services/gitCore.ts to provide comprehensive Git API including initialize repository, stage files, unstage files, commit with message, push to remote, pull from remote, create branch, switch branch, merge branches, resolve conflicts, view commit history, and check repository status, integrate DiffViewer component into file editing workflow showing before/after comparison before committing changes, implement staging area UI (src/components/GitStagingArea.tsx) with file list, hunk selection, and commit message editor, create commit history viewer (src/components/GitHistory.tsx) with branch graph visualization and cherry-pick capabilities, add conflict resolution UI that presents conflicts with AI agent suggestions for resolution, implement branch management interface showing local and remote branches with create, delete, and merge operations, and create GitHub sync UI in project workspace showing push/pull status and one-click sync button.
Enhance project listing UI with modern responsive design and GitHub integration indicators: Redesign EnhancedProjectsPage grid layout with larger cards, better spacing, and hover effects for touch and mouse interactions, add project preview thumbnails showing last edited file or project icon, implement GitHub integration status badge on each project card showing connected (with repo name) or disconnected state with connect button, create quick actions menu on each card (Open, Sync, Configure, Delete) with proper confirmation dialogs, add project sorting and filtering options (by date, name, type, GitHub status), implement project templates section showing pre-configured starter projects, add project search with real-time filtering as user types, create empty state with onboarding instructions and template selection, and ensure responsive layout works from 320px mobile to 4K desktop.
Replace all mock AI implementations with real API integrations: Remove fallback mock responses from chatStore.ts and ensure all AI calls use enhancedAIProvider with real API endpoints, implement proper error handling for AI API failures with user-friendly error messages and retry options, integrate actual Gemini API calls in enhancedAIProvider.ts using Google AI SDK with proper API key management, add OpenAI and Anthropic provider support with unified interface and automatic provider selection based on availability, implement streaming response rendering with token-by-token display and proper cancellation support, create AI usage tracking dashboard showing API calls, tokens consumed, and estimated costs per provider and project, add rate limiting and quota management to prevent API overuse, implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for transient API failures, and create API key validation UI that tests connection before saving credentials.
Build comprehensive agent orchestration system with autonomous execution: Complete implementation of agentOrchestra.ts by connecting all agent types (Planner, Coder, Designer, Debugger, Reviewer, Deployer) to real AI provider APIs for task execution, implement task decomposition where Planner agent breaks down complex user requests into sequential subtasks assigned to appropriate agents, create agent-to-agent communication protocol using message passing where agents can request information or actions from other agents, implement Web Worker-based execution for long-running agent tasks to prevent UI blocking, add agent memory integration with vector database for context retention across sessions and projects, create agent monitoring dashboard showing active tasks, execution logs, and resource usage, implement safety guardrails requiring user confirmation for destructive operations (file deletion, force push, etc.), add agent capability configuration allowing users to enable/disable specific tools per agent, and create agent learning system that improves suggestions based on user feedback.
Implement mobile-first architecture with contextual navigation: Redesign application layout to prioritize mobile interactions with proper touch targets (minimum 44px), implement swipe gestures (swipe right to go back, swipe down to refresh, long press for context menu), create contextual floating action buttons (FAB) that change based on current view (workspace: new project, project: new file, chat: new thread, terminal: new command), restructure bottom navigation to show essential items (Workspace, Projects, Chat, Settings) with active project indicator when project is open, implement project-specific bottom nav overlay when inside project showing Files, Terminal, Git, Deploy, and Back to Projects, add pull-to-refresh functionality on all list views (projects, chats, files), create proper loading states with skeleton screens and shimmer effects, implement optimistic UI updates showing changes immediately while background operations complete, add proper error boundaries with user-friendly error messages and recovery actions, ensure all interactive elements are accessible with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, and implement dark mode with proper contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards.
