# AI Dev Agentic Workspace – Smart Audit & Production TODOs

Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Roheem

Audit Snapshot (high-level)
- Present (good foundation)
  - PWA scaffold (manifest, Workbox SW), Capacitor config
  - Zustand stores (chat, project, workspace), multi-project scaffolding
  - Local vector + embeddings via TFJS/USE, semantic search engine, memory worker
  - isomorphic-git integration (local Git ops), Buffer polyfill
  - Basic AI provider manager (Gemini/OpenAI placeholders), rate-limit structure
  - UI primitives for chat and providers (components present), xterm deps
- Partial / Prototype
  - OAuth (Google/Gemini) uses placeholders; no real token exchange/refresh
  - Key aggregation/rotation across multiple accounts; basic structure, lacks robust scheduler
  - Streaming, usage accounting, cost tracking inconsistent across providers
  - Git flows beyond basics, regex/diff-first editing not fully implemented in UI
  - Two-way GitHub sync (OAuth + PR flows) missing
  - Agent orchestra stubs; no robust Planner/Coder/Designer/Debugger pipelines
  - Persistence strategy for all services (Dexie schemas/migrations) incomplete
  - Offline fallback page (offline.html) not present; SW routes expect it
- Missing / Needs Productionization
  - Mobile-first UI polish (bottom sheets, gestures, FAB, A11y), offline indicators
  - Dev container emulation (browser-based runtime, builder, terminal pipelines)
  - Deployment automation (GH Pages/Netlify/Vercel), auto-fix deploy errors
  - Security: key vault encryption, CSP hardening, permissioned tool access
  - Observability: telemetry, performance budgets, error reporting, local analytics
  - Tests: unit, e2e, performance; CI/CD
