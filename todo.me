Build browser-based development container with integrated terminal: implement virtual filesystem using OPFS (Origin Private File System) for fast file operations, create real terminal emulator (src/components/Terminal.tsx) using xterm.js with command history and autocomplete, implement command execution layer that runs git, npm-like operations in Web Workers, create build pipeline using esbuild compiled to WASM for building projects in-browser, implement live preview server using Service Worker to serve built artifacts with hot reload, add package management simulation for installing and managing dependencies, and create debugging capabilities with console output capture and error highlighting
Implement comprehensive memory and context system for AI agents: enhance vector database (src/services/enhancedVectorDatabase.ts) with proper indexing and efficient similarity search using HNSW algorithm implementation, create memory injection strategy that automatically includes relevant context from past conversations, code, and decisions in AI prompts, implement conversation summarization that condenses long chat histories while preserving key information, create knowledge graph visualization showing relationships between code files, tasks, decisions, and conversations, add memory importance scoring and automatic pruning of low-value memories based on access patterns, implement cross-project memory sharing for learning patterns across multiple projects, and create memory export/import for backing up and sharing learned knowledge
Build deployment automation system with error detection and fixes: create deployment service (src/services/deploymentAutomation.ts) with integrations for Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Pages, implement one-click deployment workflow that commits changes, runs builds, and deploys to selected platform, add deployment error detection that parses build logs and identifies common issues (missing dependencies, type errors, configuration problems), implement AI-powered error fixing where agents automatically suggest and apply fixes for deployment failures, create deployment history tracking with rollback capabilities, add environment variable management with secure storage and deployment-specific configurations, implement preview deployments for testing changes before production, and create deployment status dashboard showing build logs, deployment URLs, and health checks
Implement true concurrent multi-project support: create project workspace manager (src/services/projectWorkspaceManager.ts) that handles multiple active projects simultaneously, implement resource isolation ensuring each project has its own git state, file watchers, build processes, and agent instances, create project tab system in UI allowing users to switch between multiple projects without losing state, implement intelligent resource allocation that prioritizes active project while keeping others in low-power mode, add cross-project operations like code sharing, dependency management, and template creation, implement project templates and scaffolding for quick setup of new projects with best practices, and create workspace-level settings and configurations that apply across all projects
