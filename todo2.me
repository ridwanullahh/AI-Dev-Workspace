Production Readiness Audit and Gap Resolution
Comprehensive audit reveals critical gaps between claimed implementation and actual functionality. Key issues: GitHub OAuth UI missing from user flow, StorageService missing critical methods causing runtime errors, AI provider configuration UI disconnected from main settings, placeholder OAuth implementations still present, non-functional navigation items cluttering UI, and missing GitHub repository selection flow. Plan addresses all gaps with proper integration, UI completion, and removal of non-functional elements.
Fix StorageService runtime errors by implementing missing methods: getAIContext(), updateAIContext(), addAIContext(), getContextMemory(), updateContextMemory(), addContextMemory(), getKnowledgeNode(), updateKnowledgeNode(), and addKnowledgeNode() with proper Dexie table schemas and indexes
Remove placeholder OAuth implementation in services/oauth.ts and replace with functional Google OAuth token exchange, user info fetching, and token refresh using proper Google OAuth 2.0 endpoints with error handling and CORS proxy if needed
Implement GitHub repository integration flow: create GitHubRepoSelector component showing user's repositories with pagination/search, add repository selection to project creation modal in EnhancedProjectsPage, implement repository binding to projects in database schema, and create UI for connecting/disconnecting GitHub repos from existing projects
Build comprehensive AI Provider Configuration UI: create AIProviderSettings page with AccountManager integration, add provider configuration to main SettingsPage with tabs for each provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere), implement API key input with validation and test connection, add OAuth flow for supported providers with visual status indicators, and display usage statistics and rate limits per account
Implement GitHub OAuth device flow UI integration: add GitHub connection option to onboarding flow, create ConnectGitHub component showing device code and verification URL with QR code, add GitHub connection status to settings with disconnect option, implement automatic repository listing after successful authentication, and add GitHub avatar/username display in app header
Clean up and optimize navigation structure: remove non-functional demo pages (UI Demo, Agents, Code, Performance) from bottom navigation, redesign bottom nav with essential items only (Workspace, Projects, Chat, Settings), add contextual floating action buttons based on current page, implement project-specific navigation when project is active (Files, Terminal, Git, Deploy), and create proper settings hierarchy with AI Providers, GitHub, Appearance, and About sections
Implement proper project creation and initialization workflow: enhance project creation modal with GitHub repository selection option, add template selection UI with previews, implement local-only project option with OPFS filesystem initialization, add Git initialization checkbox with remote URL input, create project onboarding wizard for first-time users, and implement project import from existing GitHub repositories
Build GitHub synchronization and repository management features: implement pull/push UI with conflict resolution dialog, add branch management UI with visual branch switcher, create commit history viewer with graph visualization, implement PR creation workflow from app, add webhook configuration UI for real-time sync, and create sync status indicator in project header
Complete end-to-end testing and validation: test GitHub OAuth flow from start to finish, validate AI provider API key configuration and usage, test project creation with all options (blank, template, clone, import), verify Git operations (commit, push, pull, branch) work correctly, test offline functionality and data persistence, validate error handling and user feedback throughout app, and ensure mobile responsiveness on actual devices
